# Recipe-Search-From-File
This program allows the user to search for different recipes based on their name, cooking time, or the name of an ingredient. It takes all of this information from a file the user provides, a file that is divided so:
Each recipe consists of three or more rows in a recipe file: 
-The first row is for the name of the recipe.
-The second row if for the cooking time (an integer).
-The third and following rows list the ingredients used in the recipe. 
-An empty row signals that the recipe is over, and that the row after it starts a new recipe.
