# Recipe-Search-From-File
<h1>Made with JAVA</h1>
<div><p>This program allows the user to search for different recipes based on their name, cooking time, or the name of an ingredient. It takes all of this information from a file the user provides, a file that is divided so:</p>
  <h3>Each recipe consists of three or more rows in a recipe file:</h3>
  <ul> 
    <li>The first row is for the name of the recipe.</li>
<li>The second row if for the cooking time (an integer).</li>
<li>The third and following rows list the ingredients used in the recipe. </li>
<li>An empty row signals that the recipe is over, and that the row after it starts a new recipe.</li>
  </ul>
